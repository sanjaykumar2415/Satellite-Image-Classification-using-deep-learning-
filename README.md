# Satellite-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning


The goal of this project is to track changes in the Amazon rainforest due to deforestation using satellite image data. It is a multi-label image classification problem introduced in a past Kaggle competition Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space. The final solution consists of an ensemble of five deep learning models using transfer learning with the fastai library which would have placed 19th in the competition.
